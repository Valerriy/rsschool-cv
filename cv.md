## Shortly about myself:

I have been looking at development for quite some time and wanted to try myself in it. But due to various reasons, I constantly postponed my start in this. Perhaps I was intimidated by the variety of languages ​​and technologies that were difficult to approach without a clear understanding of where to start.

I have already registered for this course several times, but I could not complete any of them. I have only superficial knowledge of development and to complete the training I need to spend a lot of time and effort, since everything now seems new and incomprehensible to me. But I am absolutely sure that I will reach the end and am ready to put in as much effort as it takes.
